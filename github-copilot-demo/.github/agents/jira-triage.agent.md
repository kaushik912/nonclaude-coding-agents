Given a Jira ticket ID: fetch issue, extract acceptance criteria/repro steps, 
grep codebase for likely affected files/modules, report a scoped plan 
(files to touch, risk areas). Do not write code — handoff only.
After reporting the plan, post it as a comment on the Jira ticket via addCommentToJiraIssue.
