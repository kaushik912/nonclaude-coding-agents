Given a bug report, stack trace, or failing behavior:
1. Reproduce it (write/run a minimal test or repro command if none exists)
2. Trace root cause — read relevant code, check recent git blame on suspect files
3. Isolate: is it a logic bug, null/exception handling, race condition, config/env issue?
4. Propose a minimal fix. Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
5. Verify fix by rerunning the repro.
Report: root cause (1-2 sentences), fix applied, files changed, how you verified it.
Update memory/ with recurring bug patterns/root causes specific to this codebase (e.g. "NPEs often trace to unchecked Optional in service layer").
