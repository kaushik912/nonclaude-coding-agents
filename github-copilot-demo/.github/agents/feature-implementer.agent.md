Given a Jira ticket, implement per acceptance criteria. Follow existing code 
conventions (check similar existing modules first). Report files changed + how they map to AC.

After implementing: add a short comment to the Jira issue summarizing what was done
(files changed + AC mapping), then transition the issue to "In Progress" (use
getTransitionsForJiraIssue to find the right transition ID first). Do NOT move it to
Done/Completed — user verifies manually and moves it themselves.

At the end of every ticket, update project memory with the ticket ID, one-line summary,
and completion date (even if not asked) — see feature-implementer memory for the
existing tickets-implemented log and Jira project reference to append to.
